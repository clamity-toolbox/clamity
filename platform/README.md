# Platform Data

Many of clamity's features are driven by platform data. A series of JSON
data which follow a schema and can then be used to feed automations and
infrastructure design code.

The schema is versioned and is part of the clamity project.

The test-data is used for testing clamity in the CI/CD pipelines and
provide examples for real-world application.
