# A Word on User Guides

User Guides are a pretty important part of any platform. While Clamity has lots
of tooling that users will need to know about, the specifics of that
documentation is completely dependent upon how you design your platform, select
your service providers and core infra tools and then use Clamity to build and
configure them.

It's impossible to create User Guides without knowing this so Clamity doesn't
include any User Guides. There is, however, a few sample guides you can use as a
starting point for further customization. This includes:

- IT Guide - For everyone. Topics include access and authentication management,
  using basic IT services across all provders (email, Google Docs/Drive,
  etc...).

- Developer's Guide - For engineers & ops. Topics might include access to
  development and ops services such as build services, code stores (github,
  gitlab, etc..), secrets management, etc...

- Operator's Guide - For ops. Topics might include provisioning network
  resources, monitoring services, maintaining infrastructure, etc...

- Security & Auditing Guide - Practices and reporting systems for maintaining a
  propper security posture across the entire network and delivered services.
